# What is Oathbound Project
 
The Oathbound Project is a complete overhaul of the vanilla experience, aiming to expand the possibilities while keeping things as simple and familiar as good old vanilla Minecraft.

While maintaining this simplicity, we will introduce some complexity to encourage more players to engage with the modding community.
The most ambitious part of the project is achieving a multi-version experience by keeping up with major Minecraft updates. We’ll start with 1.21.1 and, once 1.22 becomes stable enough for our mod list, we’ll transition to it.

It’s possible that we’ll add more mods in the future, but for now, that’s not our focus. So please don’t ask us to add new mods—we won’t be doing that anytime soon.
